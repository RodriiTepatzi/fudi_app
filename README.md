# Fudi App

This is a delivery app made by a student to acquire new knowledge.

## Getting Started

This project is being developed using an MVC structure. It uses nested objects but it does have an API that was made to avoid erros when nesting from a json array. So it does not make only one call to the API. You can check this at Services folder.

API is developed in C#. Using ASP.NET Core MVC Framework. This also will contain a full web application.
Mobile App is being made using Flutter and Dart. Trying not to use native code to test performance.

## Features
